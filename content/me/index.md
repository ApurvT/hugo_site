Hey, I am Apurv Tiwari.

<!--My name is a little exotic and challenging, but it looks more complicated than it is. The first name can be divided into three parts, ea (from earl) + poor + rv (from verve). The surname speaks as is written.-->

I am a cybersecurity engineer, exploring different domains within information security. I am experienced in designing assessments, refreshing cyber policies, and teaching cybersecurity. I love dabbling in new and exciting projects. Reach out to me if you think I can help you.

<!--My foray with computers started in 2005, when I played my very first game, Dangerous Dave! I slowly moved from gaming to making my own flash games(these were the rage at one time! They were also the source of so many malware!), designing and building my own PC, acquiring a working knowledge of it's internals!

 It was in 2012 that I finally stepped up and committed myself for a 4 year rigorous undergraduate program (Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering). I went through a lot of new concepts, exposed to multiple languages, methodologies, theoretical compute science, finite automate and state machines, assembly language, Operating System fundamentals. In 2016 I met my new obsession, I fell in love with cryptography, not with it's more practical and way cooler cousin(ethical hacking). I was immensely attracted to the mathematical aspect of cryptographic algorithms. This fascination prompted me to pursue my second degree, Master's in Cybersecurity Engineering. 

In 2016, I set off for my Master's degree at University of Southern California. I learnt a lot in the next two years. I discovered so many more paths in cybersecurity, there was digital forensics, incident response, malware analysis, threat hunting, secure system design and ofcourse classical cryptography. I slowly drifted towards the compliance side of cyber, trying my hand with the various laws that companies were required to be compliant with. I also learnt how to skateboard, surf, ski and went for my first ever sky dive. Over the two years I matured a lot as a person, exploring a lot. I was able to join the Archery team at USC and became a level 2 certified Archer(Olympic Recurve). -->
